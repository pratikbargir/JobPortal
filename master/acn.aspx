                            ACN, LLC (formerly ACN, Inc.) is a North-American based multi-level marketing 
                            (MLM) company which provides telecommunications, energy, merchant services and 
                            other services, depending on the country, through a network of independent sales 
                            agents known as &quot;Independent Business Owners&quot; (IBOs), who themselves can recruit 
                            new sales agents. IBOs earn residual income and bonuses through the acquisition 
                            of personal customers, as well as customers by other IBOs they recruit. Based in 
                            Concord, North Carolina, United States, ACN began operations in the United 
                            States in 1993 as an American Communications Network. It extended operations to 
                            Europe in 1999, to the Pacific in 2004, to Asia in 2011, and now operates in 25 
                            countries, on four continents.
