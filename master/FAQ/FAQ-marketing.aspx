                    As you answer questions about your accomplishments with other companies, be 
                    specific. Simply stating, “I ran several online marketing campaigns” does not 
                    adequately show what you can do for the company.&nbsp; Better answers should 
                    resemble, “I started a social media campaign that utilized targeted advertising 
                    systems to market the company’s services to youth in North America.” You will 
                    also need to elaborate. Use numbers that support the campaign, such as “Within 
                    three financial quarters, sales increased by 427% and brand recognition vastly 
                    improved by 10% within the target demographic.”<o:p></o:p></p>

                    Interview questions about the future should be brought back to accomplishments 
                    of the past. In other words, when asked about how you would deal with possible 
                    future scenarios, refer to your past accomplishments.&nbsp; Your answers should 
                    focus on successful campaigns with statement such as, “While I was with company 
                    XYZ, I initiated both low cost lead generation strategies and several viral 
                    marketing campaigns, using an almost inexistent budget to boost profits by 
                    200%.”<o:p></o:p></p>

                    This common job interview question is often asked in every type of interview. 
                    But for marketing jobs this question is especially important. It provides you 
                    with a chance to tout your interview preparation by suggesting effective 
                    marketing strategies based on the research you completed on the company.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    Start by discussing your overall qualifications and experience, but then amend 
                    those answers with statements such as, “As I researched your company, I noticed 
                    that while your online marketing presence was strong, there are several areas 
                    that could be built upon including…” and following up with your ideas. However, 
                    you should refrain from this answer if you are interviewing with the head of the 
                    marketing department, as you may be undermining their beliefs.<o:p></o:p></p>
