                    why you’re doing what you’re doing. Was there someone in your past who inspired 
                    you and you want to pay that forward and inspire others? Draw from specific

                    I was in third grade I struggled a lot with reading. I could never keep up with 
                    lessons and I was always terrified of being called on to practice my reading out 
                    loud. I started to doubt my own intelligence and was convinced that the bottom 
                    line was I was stupid. It ended up affecting my grades and I started to fall 
                    behind. Rather than give up on me, my teacher Miss Emily sat me down one day at 
                    lunch and really talked to me about what was going on. I told her how hard it 
                    was for me to read and we discovered together that I wasn’t stupid, but was 
                    having vision problems. She moved me to a desk that was closer to the front, 
                    made sure I was able to see, and met with my parents to discuss options. Because 
                    of her my parents took me to a doctor and my astigmatism was diagnosed. Because 
                    of Miss Emily I began to love learning again. I want to be that teacher…the one 
                    who takes the time to really discover why students are struggling and give 
                    another little girl like me an opportunity to learn to love learning again.</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt;

                    spent a lot of time researching schools within this district and I’m very 
                    impressed with what you offer here. Between an award winning teaching staff and 
                    a district that is very involved, your school has a teacher-to-student ratio 
                    that I think really allows for personalized education. Smaller classroom sizes, 
                    like the ones you maintain here, make it possible for me to give each child the 
                    one-on-one attention they deserve. On top of that, your after-school science 
                    program is exciting to me and I would hope, should I get hired here, that I 
                    might be able to become involved in that as well.</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:

                    This question is pretty straight forward, and the perfect opportunity for you to 
                    really let your unique qualities shine. Talk about activities you’ve 
                    participated in or passions you have that can easily translate into teachable 
                    moments and classroom activities that fall outside the usual curriculum that is 
                    currently being enacted. Don’t criticize what they’re doing, but explain how 
                    what you’re bringing will augment and compliment what they’ve already got in 
                    place.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    love science and exploring the natural world beyond the borders of the 
                    classroom. For that reason, I started an after-school explorer’s club at my last 
                    school. We would go on nature hikes, visit museums and invite local scientists 
                    and biologists to come speak to us about what they’re working on and their 
                    research. The response was overwhelming and I have students who still come up to 
                    me years later and tell me how much they loved our club and how it helped 
                    inspire them to pursue careers in the sciences. I would be very interested in

                    This question allows your interviewers to get to know what it takes to ruffle 
                    your feathers and how you’ll behave when faced with that situation. Find a 
                    situation that is fairly common for all teachers and then explain how you’ve 
                    dealt with that frustration. Remember, you want to focus on positive aspects of 
                    your teaching style, so if you’re still frustrated with a situation and haven’t

                    have to admit, I get frustrated by the kids who think they’re too cool for

                    teachers who play into that attitude. Rather than turn that frustration into 
                    anger or simply ignore them and wait for a slacker to drift through a year in my 
                    class, I turn that frustration into a challenge for both the student and myself. 
                    Most of the time those kids are too cool because of challenges they’re facing 
                    outside of school and their attitude is a way for them to protect themselves. 
                    Sometimes all they need is to know someone else believes in them. By giving them 
                    a little extra attention and encouragement, I’ve seen some of the ‘coolest kids’

                    believe that the best learning opportunities are the ones that the students come 
                    up with themselves. For that reason I spend every lunch hour on the playground 
                    with my students and make myself available for them to ask me 
                    “playground-pop-quiz” questions. These questions have ranged from everything 
                    from how is the ice cream we had at lunch made to exploring the lifecycle of the 
                    mosquitos we found in a piece of playground equipment. I love challenging the 
                    students to try to stump me and as a result, they go out of their way to explore 
                    the environment around them, making learning fun and exciting.</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
